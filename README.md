# RotationExcercise

A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] , then the array would become    [3, 4, 5, 1, 2] .
Given an array a of n integers and a number d, perform d left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.
